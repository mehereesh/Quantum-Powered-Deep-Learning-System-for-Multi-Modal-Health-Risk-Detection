# Quantum-Powered-Deep-Learning-System-for-Multi-Modal-Health-Risk-Detection

In today’s fast-evolving world of healthcare, early and accurate detection of diseases can save lives. Our project focuses on creating a comprehensive health risk detection system that combines quantum computing techniques with deep learning algorithms to analyze and classify a wide range of health conditions.

The system processes different types of medical data—including brain MRI scans, ECG signals, chest X-rays, spinal cord MRIs, and basic vitals like heart rate and oxygen levels. By doing so, it provides an all-in-one platform for identifying diseases such as brain tumors, cardiac issues, respiratory disorders, and neurological conditions.

What sets this system apart is its speed and efficiency. Traditional machine learning methods often take a lot of time to process and can fall short in accuracy. In contrast, our system has shown to classify hundreds of images in a matter of seconds while maintaining high reliability. By leveraging the strengths of quantum-inspired processing and deep learning models, we aim to build a medical diagnostic tool that is not only powerful but also practical for real-world use.
